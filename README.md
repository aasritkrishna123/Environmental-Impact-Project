# 🌱 Environmental Impact Dashboard – Tableau Project

## 📖 Project Overview

This project presents an **Environmental Impact Analysis Dashboard** built using **Tableau**, designed to monitor and analyze sustainability metrics across regions, industries, and product types.

The dashboard provides a **holistic view of environmental performance**, focusing on carbon emissions, energy usage, water consumption, recycling rates, and regulatory compliance. It enables stakeholders to make **data-driven sustainability decisions** through interactive visual analytics.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Track **total carbon emissions, energy usage, and water consumption**
* Analyze **recycling performance** across regions and industries
* Monitor **compliance levels** with environmental regulations
* Identify **regional and industry-level sustainability trends**
* Understand the **relationship between recycling rates and carbon emissions**

---

## 📦 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes environmental and operational metrics such as:

* **Year**
* **Region**
* **Industry**
* **Product Type**
* **Carbon Emissions**
* **Energy Usage**
* **Water Consumption**
* **Recycling Rate**
* **Compliance Level**

This structured data supports **trend analysis, comparisons, and correlation studies**.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Tableau** – Interactive dashboard development
* **Data Cleaning & Modeling** (pre-processed before visualization)
* **Calculated Fields & Parameters**
* **Interactive Filters & Drill-Downs**

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

* **KPI Cards** displaying total carbon emissions, energy usage, water consumption, and average recycling rate
* **Water Consumption by Region** comparison
* **Energy Usage Trend Analysis** over multiple years
* **Recycling Rates by Region and Industry** (heatmap)
* **Compliance Level Distribution** (donut chart)
* **Correlation between Carbon Emissions and Recycling Rates**
* Global filters for **Year, Product Type, Industry, Region, and Compliance Level**

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Certain regions contribute disproportionately to **carbon emissions and energy usage**
* Higher recycling rates generally align with **lower carbon emission intensity**
* Compliance levels are evenly distributed, indicating room for stricter sustainability policies
* Water and energy consumption patterns vary significantly by **industry type**

---

## 📌 Business Recommendations

* Prioritize sustainability initiatives in regions with **high carbon and energy footprints**
* Introduce region-specific environmental benchmarks

### 2. ♻ Strengthen Recycling Programs

* Invest in industries with **low recycling rates but high emissions**
* Promote best practices from high-performing regions

### 3. 📉 Reduce Resource Consumption

* Encourage energy-efficient technologies in high-usage industries
* Implement water conservation strategies where consumption is highest

### 4. 🧠 Use Dashboard for Policy Monitoring

* Leverage compliance insights to track regulatory adherence
* Use trends to support **environmental reporting and ESG decision-making**

---

## 🚀 Project Outcome

This dashboard enables:

* Clear **visibility into sustainability performance**
* Faster **decision-making through interactive analytics**
* Effective **ESG and environmental impact monitoring**
